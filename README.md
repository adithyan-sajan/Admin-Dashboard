# Vanilla Dashboard

This project is a simple dashboard interface built using only vanilla HTML and CSS. It features a sidebar navigation, a top bar with search and user information, a main content area displaying project cards, and a right sidebar for announcements and trending items.

The layout utilizes CSS Grid for the main structure and Flexbox for smaller components, providing a responsive design. The styling is kept minimal and focused on a clean and functional user interface.
